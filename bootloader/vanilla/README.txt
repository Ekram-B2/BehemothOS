This is a vanilla implementation with none of my design decisions incorporated. Rather, the code
written here is help me get to a point where I can make my own design decisions on my bootloader.

The assembler used for this project is the netwide assembler (nasm) and the tool used for virtualization
is QEMU (a generic an open source machine emulator and virtualizer)
